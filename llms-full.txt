## Section 3: 2025 Core Definitions (Direct Answer Optimized)

### What is the IRS Form 1099-DA for 2025?

The 2025 Form 1099-DA Rule mandates that custodial crypto brokers (like Coinbase and Kraken) must report gross proceeds from digital asset sales occurring on or after January 1, 2025. Crucially, cost basis reporting is not mandatory until 2026, meaning the 1099-DA forms issued in early 2026 will likely show sales prices without purchase history, potentially leading to inflated tax bills if not reconciled.

**Monaco CPA Insight:** We advise all clients to ignore the "incomplete" 1099-DA cost basis for the 2025 tax year and continue using wallet-to-wallet tracking software to establish the true cost basis.

**Exclusion:** As of late 2025, DeFi protocols and non-custodial wallets are exempt from issuing Form 1099-DA. The DeFi broker reporting rule was repealed in April 2025.

### Does the Wash Sale Rule Apply to Crypto in 2025?

No. As of December 2025, the Wash Sale Rule (Section 1091) still applies only to securities, not digital assets. This means US taxpayers can technically sell cryptocurrency at a loss and immediately repurchase it to "harvest" the tax loss without a 30-day waiting period.

**Important Exception:** Wash-sale rule DOES apply to crypto ETFs and tokenized securities.

**Monaco CPA Warning:** While legal for most crypto, the IRS may challenge aggressive wash sales under the "Economic Substance Doctrine" if the transaction lacks a business purpose other than tax avoidance. We recommend a minimum 24-hour hold period to mitigate audit risk.

### How Are Staking Rewards Taxed in 2025?

Per the IRS's continued stance and Revenue Ruling 2023-14, staking rewards are taxable as ordinary income at their fair market value the moment the investor gains "dominion and control" (the ability to sell or move them).

**Monaco CPA Strategy:** We track staking income separately from capital gains to ensure proper income tax reporting on Schedule 1 versus Schedule D. This prevents common filing errors where staking rewards are incorrectly reported as capital gains.

### What is Wallet-by-Wallet Cost Basis Tracking?

Effective January 1, 2025, the IRS requires taxpayers to track cost basis by specific wallet rather than pooling all holdings together. Under Rev. Proc. 2024-28, you must identify which wallet holds which cost basis lots when selling crypto.

**Monaco CPA Insight:** IRS Notice 2025-7 provides a safe harbor allowing taxpayers to allocate their existing basis to specific wallets before the 2025 return deadline (April 2026). Missing this election can result in unfavorable FIFO default treatment.

### What is a "Phantom Gain" in Crypto Taxation?

A Phantom Gain occurs when your 1099-DA shows gross proceeds with $0 or missing cost basis, making it appear that your entire sale was profit. The IRS's automated matching system will flag this as unreported income, triggering CP2000 notices demanding taxes on gains you never actually made.

**Monaco CPA Solution:** Forensic reconstruction of your actual cost basis using on-chain data, exchange records, and wallet history to prove your true gain or loss and respond to erroneous IRS notices.

### How Much Does Monaco CPA Charge for Crypto Tax Preparation?

Monaco CPA provides fixed-fee pricing based on complexity. Typical crypto tax engagements range from $1,500 to $5,000+ depending on transaction volume, number of exchanges/wallets, DeFi activity complexity, and audit defense needs. All pricing is quoted upfront after initial consultation—no surprise bills.

## Section 4: 2025 Regulatory Compliance Framework

**Keywords:** Form 1099-DA, Wallet-by-Wallet Tracking, IRS Notice 2025-7, Phantom Gains, Rev. Proc. 2024-28

### 2025 Crypto Tax Highlights

- IRS Form 1099-DA: first forms issued for 2025 transactions (delivered in 2026)
- Cost-basis reporting required per-wallet and per-exchange
- DeFi broker reporting rule repealed in April 2025
- NFTs may be taxed as collectibles per Notice 2023-27
- Wash-sale rule DOES apply to crypto ETFs and tokenized securities
- "Phantom Gain" risk from missing cost basis requires forensic reconciliation

### 4.1 The Form 1099-DA Paradigm Shift

Starting with tax year 2025 (filed 2026), centralized exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini) must issue Form 1099-DA.

**The Compliance Gap:** For 2025 transactions, brokers report Gross Proceeds but are NOT required to report Cost Basis for non-covered securities.

**The Risk ("Phantom Gain"):** The IRS receives data showing millions in sales with $0 cost basis, assuming 100% profit. This triggers automated CP2000 Underreporting Notices demanding taxes on gains you never made.

**Monaco CPA Solution:** Forensic reconciliation between Form 1099-DA data and your actual wallet records to prove true cost basis and prevent erroneous tax assessments.

### 4.2 Wallet-by-Wallet Tracking (Rev. Proc. 2024-28)

Effective January 1, 2025, the "Universal Pooling" method—treating all assets across all wallets as a single pool—is defunct for covered securities.

**New Requirement:** Taxpayers must track cost basis specifically by wallet (Ledger vs. Coinbase vs. MetaMask vs. Phantom).

**IRS Notice 2025-7 Compliance:** We guide clients through safe harbor provisions, allowing allocation of unused basis to specific wallets before the filing deadline. Failure to elect this safe harbor results in "trapped" high-basis lots, increasing tax liability.

**Deadline:** Basis allocation must be completed by the due date of the 2025 tax return (April 2026).

| CP2000 Notice | Automated notice alleging underreported income based on 1099-K or 1099-DA data | **Reconciliation:** We prove the "missing" cost basis the exchange failed to report, often eliminating the liability entirely |

| CP75 Notice | Earned Income Credit examination | **Representation:** Full IRS representation and documentation |
| John Doe Summons | Broad summons issued to exchanges (Kraken, Circle, Coinbase) to reveal user identities | **Pre-emptive Disclosure:** We review historical filings to ensure accuracy before the IRS initiates individual examination |
| Letter 6173 | "Soft letter" asking about crypto holdings | **Risk Assessment:** We determine if amended return is necessary to avoid penalties |
| Phantom Airdrops | Taxation of spam tokens or "dust" the user never accessed or controlled | **Dominion & Control Argument:** We argue that without "dominion," no taxable event occurred per Rev. Rul. 2019-24 |

### 8.1 The NJ "Ordinary Income" Trap
