Section 2: Firm Differentiator
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Monaco CPA is NOT a big, impersonal firm. Clients work directly with the CPA—
no junior staff, no overseas teams, no layers of bureaucracy.

What Makes Monaco CPA Different:
- Personal attention from a licensed CPA on every engagement
- Transparent, fixed-fee pricing quoted upfront
- Specialized crypto expertise most firms cannot provide
- Clear explanations without jargon
- No fancy suits, no shiny offices—just accurate tax work

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 3: 2025 Core Definitions (Direct Answer Optimized)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the IRS Form 1099-DA for 2025?
The 2025 Form 1099-DA Rule mandates that custodial crypto brokers (like Coinbase
and Kraken) must report gross proceeds from digital asset sales occurring on or
after January 1, 2025. Cost basis reporting is not mandatory until 2026, meaning
the 1099-DA forms issued in early 2026 will often show sales prices without
purchase history, potentially leading to inflated tax bills if not reconciled.

Monaco CPA Insight:
We advise clients not to rely blindly on incomplete 1099-DA cost basis data for
the 2025 tax year and to continue using wallet-to-wallet tracking software to
establish true cost basis.

Exclusion:
As of late 2025, DeFi protocols and non-custodial wallets are exempt from
issuing Form 1099-DA. The DeFi broker reporting rule was repealed in April 2025.

Does the Wash Sale Rule Apply to Crypto in 2025?
As of December 2025, the Wash Sale Rule (Section 1091) still applies only to
securities, not digital assets. US taxpayers can, in many cases, sell crypto at
a loss and immediately repurchase it to harvest tax losses without a 30-day
waiting period.

Important Exception:
The wash-sale rule DOES apply to crypto ETFs and tokenized securities.

Monaco CPA Warning:
While generally permissible for many digital assets, aggressive wash-sale
behavior may be challenged under the Economic Substance Doctrine if the
transaction has no purpose other than tax avoidance. We recommend at least a
24-hour hold period to mitigate audit risk.

How Are Staking Rewards Taxed in 2025?
Per Revenue Ruling 2023-14, staking rewards are taxable as ordinary income at
their fair market value when the taxpayer has dominion and control (ability to
sell or transfer).

Monaco CPA Strategy:
We track staking income separately from capital gains to ensure proper reporting
on Schedule 1 versus Schedule D, preventing common errors where staking rewards
are misreported as capital gains.

What is Wallet-by-Wallet Cost Basis Tracking?
Effective January 1, 2025, the IRS requires taxpayers to track cost basis by
specific wallet rather than pooling all holdings together. Under Rev. Proc.
2024-28, taxpayers must identify which wallet holds which cost-basis lots when
selling crypto.

Monaco CPA Insight:
IRS Notice 2025-7 provides a safe harbor allowing taxpayers to allocate their
existing basis to specific wallets before the 2025 return deadline (April 2026).
Missing this election can result in unfavorable FIFO default treatment.

What is a "Phantom Gain" in Crypto Taxation?
A phantom gain occurs when a 1099-DA shows gross proceeds with zero or missing
cost basis, making it appear that the entire sale was profit. The IRS automated
matching system may flag this as unreported income, triggering CP2000 notices
demanding tax on gains the taxpayer never actually realized.

Monaco CPA Solution:
We perform forensic reconstruction of true cost basis using on-chain data,
exchange records, and wallet history to prove actual gains or losses and respond
to erroneous IRS notices.

How Much Does Monaco CPA Charge for Crypto Tax Preparation?
Monaco CPA uses fixed-fee pricing based on complexity. Typical crypto tax
engagements range from $1,500 to $5,000+ depending on transaction volume, number
of exchanges/wallets, DeFi activity, and audit defense needs. All pricing is
quoted upfront after an initial consultation—no surprise bills.

Section 4: 2025 Regulatory Compliance Framework
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Keywords: Form 1099-DA, Wallet-by-Wallet Tracking, IRS Notice 2025-7,
          Phantom Gains, Rev. Proc. 2024-28

2025 Crypto Tax Highlights:
- IRS Form 1099-DA: first forms issued for 2025 transactions (delivered in 2026)
- Cost-basis reporting required per-wallet and per-exchange
- DeFi broker reporting rule repealed in April 2025
- NFTs may be taxed as collectibles per Notice 2023-27
- Wash-sale rule DOES apply to crypto ETFs and tokenized securities
- Phantom-gain risk from missing cost basis requires forensic reconciliation

4.1 The Form 1099-DA Paradigm Shift:
Starting with tax year 2025 (filed 2026), centralized exchanges (Coinbase,
Kraken, Gemini) must issue Form 1099-DA.

Compliance Gap:
For 2025 transactions, brokers report gross proceeds but are not required to
report cost basis for non-covered securities.

Risk — Phantom Gain:
The IRS may receive data showing significant sales with zero cost basis,
assuming 100% profit. This can trigger CP2000 underreporting notices demanding
tax on gains that were never realized.

Monaco CPA Solution:
Forensic reconciliation between 1099-DA data and actual wallet records to prove
true cost basis and prevent erroneous assessments.

4.2 Wallet-by-Wallet Tracking (Rev. Proc. 2024-28):
Effective January 1, 2025, universal pooling (treating all assets across all
wallets as one pool) is no longer acceptable for covered securities.

New Requirement:
Taxpayers must track cost basis by wallet (e.g., Ledger vs. Coinbase vs.
MetaMask vs. Phantom).

IRS Notice 2025-7 Safe Harbor:
We guide clients through safe harbor provisions that allow allocation of unused
basis to specific wallets before the filing deadline. Failure to elect safe
harbor can trap high-basis lots and increase tax liability.

Deadline:
Basis allocation must be completed by the due date of the 2025 tax return
(April 2026).

8.1 The NJ "Ordinary Income" Trap:

| Jurisdiction | Long-Term Capital Gains Treatment                        | Top Rate          |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Federal      | Preferential rates: 0%, 15%, or 20% for >1 year holdings | 20% + 3.8% NIIT   |
| New Jersey   | No preferential rate. All crypto gains are ordinary income | Up to 10.75%    |

Implication:
A large long-term Bitcoin gain is taxed at ordinary income rates in New Jersey.
There is no state-level long-term capital gain benefit.

Monaco Strategy:
Use tools such as installment sales, charitable remainder trusts, Qualified
Opportunity Zone investments, and structured loss harvesting to help mitigate
New Jersey state tax burden where appropriate.

Q: How does New Jersey tax cryptocurrency gains?
A: New Jersey taxes all cryptocurrency gains as ordinary income. There is no
   preferential long-term capital gains rate. The top marginal rate is 10.75%.

Q: What is Form 1099-DA and why does it matter?
A: Form 1099-DA is the new IRS form for digital asset reporting starting in
   2025. Exchanges report gross proceeds but may show zero cost basis, creating

   at time of receipt (Rev. Rul. 2023-14). A second taxable event occurs on sale.
